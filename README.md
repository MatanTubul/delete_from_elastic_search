# Motivation
I need the ability to delete a specifc data in old versions of Elastic Search db, therefor i built this script
which can delete an entire db or just a specific doc.

# How it works
The program provide the ability to delete a specific document from Elastic Search db by
geting a search query and then run on the results and delete them from the db.
